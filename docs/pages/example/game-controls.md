In this example, the user can press their keyboard's arrow keys to move around the map with game-like controls.

The map uses [`panBy`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#panby) to move forward and backward, and [`easeTo`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#easeto) to move left and right.
