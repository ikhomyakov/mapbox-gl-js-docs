This example uses [`addImage`](/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addimage) to generate an icon at runtime and add it to a map style. Then, it adds the icon to the map by including the `'layout': {'icon-image': 'gradient'}` statement inside [`addLayer`](/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addlayer).

{{ <Example html={html} {...this.props} /> }}
